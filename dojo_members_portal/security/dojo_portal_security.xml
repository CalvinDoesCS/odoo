    <!--
        The dojo_base module already defines row-level record rules that restrict
        portal users (group_dojo_parent_student) to their own household data for
        dojo.member, dojo.household, dojo.guardian.link, dojo.class.enrollment,
        dojo.attendance.log, dojo.emergency.contact, and dojo.member.subscription.

        Invoice access for portal users is handled entirely inside the
        DojoMemberPortal controller (controllers/main.py) using sudo() with
        explicit household-scoped ID filtering. No additional record rule is
        needed here because portal users never query account.move directly.
